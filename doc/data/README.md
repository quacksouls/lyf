# Data, darta, dayta

This chapter will show you various ways to juggle basic data types in
JavaScript. A data type is something like a number or a character of the English
alphabet. When you have a sequence of characters, you get a data type called a
_string_ because you are stringing together a bunch of characters in a given
order. You will learn about another data type called _boolean_, whose only
values are either `true` or `false`. Numbers, strings, and booleans are among
the most fundamental building blocks upon which you construct your programs.
