This section will show you various ways to juggle basic data types in
JavaScript.

## Pick a number

Numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating point numbers. The integer 42
and the number 42.0 have the same representation. This is convenient for working
with numbers because you do not need to worry about whether a number is an
integer or floating point.

Underneath it all, JavaScript uses 64 bits to represent each number. Why do you
need to know that each number in JavaScript is 64-bit? Usually you do not need
to care that a number is 64-bit. However, if you are working on a program that
uses very large numbers, you would have to worry about whether 64 bits are
enough for your purpose. Use the following program to help you determine the
smallest and largest numbers that can be represented on your computer. My
computer has a 64-bit CPU and the results of the program running on my computer
are given in the comments. As you can see, the largest _safe_ integer I can have
on my computer is a little over 9 quadrillion and the smallest _safe_ integer is
the negative of the largest _safe_ integer.

```js
/**
 * Largest and smallest numbers in JavaScript.
 *
 * @param ns The Netscript API.
 */
export async function main(ns) {
    ns.tprint(Number.MIN_VALUE); // 5e-324
    ns.tprint(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER); // -9007199254740991
    ns.tprint(Number.MAX_VALUE); // 1.7976931348623157e+308
    ns.tprint(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991
}
```

Look again closely at the comments in the program. Why is the letter `e` in two
of the numbers? A number written as `5e3` or `1.5e4` is using scientific
notation. The letter `e` here means "exponent", telling you the exponent to
which you must raise `10`. Consider the number `5e3`. You write down `5`. The
part `e3` tells you to raise `10` to the power of `3`, i.e. `1000`. Now multiply
`5` by `1000` to obtain `5,000`. Thus `5e3` is a compact representation of the
expanded form `5,000`. By way of another example, the number `1.5e4` means that
you write down `1.5`. Raise `10` to the power of `4` to get `10,000`. Now
multiply `1.5` by `10,000` and you have `15,000`, which is the expanded version
of `1.5e4`. As you can see, the `e` (or scientific) notation is handy whenever
you want a compact representation for a large or small number. Do you want to
write 7 million in your program as `7000000` or as `7e6`?

JavaScript defines three special numbers:
[`NaN`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN),
positive
[`Infinity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity),
and
[`-Infinity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Infinity).
The symbol `NaN` means Not-A-Number. It results when a number conversion fails
or an operation cannot be performed on two numbers, among other reasons. For
example, you would get `NaN` if you try to evaluate `0 / 0`. In some programming
languages, attempting to divide zero by zero would result in the immediate halt
of your program. JavaScript is lenient, but you still need to guard against
having something as absurd as `0 / 0` in your programs. The symbol `NaN` can
also be accessed as `Number.NaN`.

Positive `Infinity` is defined in JavaScript as the number greater than every
other number in the language. Similarly, `-Infinity` is defined as the number
smaller than every other number. These two numbers are useful in certain
situations, but do not expect them to behave like their formal mathematical
definitions. The special numbers `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are the same as
[`Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/POSITIVE_INFINITY)
and
[`Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/NEGATIVE_INFINITY),
respectively.

> _Exercise 1._ Write the number `420,000,000` in terms of scientific notation.
>
> _Exercise 2._ Write the expanded form of the number `9.6e1`.
>
> _Exercise 3._ Why is the number `5e-3` different from `-5e3`?
>
> _Exercise 4._ [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) has up-to-date
> documentation about JavaScript. You should be consulting the
> [JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
> on MDN as you learn JavaScript. Spend some time to browse through the
> reference now. Do not worry if everything is incomprehensible at the moment.
> For now, it is more important that you are familiar with the structure of the
> reference rather than its contents.

> _Exercise 6._ JavaScript also allows you to handle huge integers that do not
> fit within 64 bits. Browse through the documentation of
> [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)
> to see what JavaScript has to offer in terms of very large integers.
