# Bitburner

Familiarize yourself with the Bitburner environment. Open the game in
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/) or use the
[online version](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/). You should see
something similar to the left panel of the image below. The game places you at
the in-game tutorial. Continue with the tutorial if you want. Otherwise click
the button <kbd>SKIP TUTORIAL</kbd> and you should see something like the right
panel of the image below. This is the terminal window of the game. The terminal
window, abbreviated as terminal, is an area of the game that allows you to type
in various commands to play the game. You know you are at the terminal because
the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> tab is highlighted green. Spend some time exploring the
other tabs. When you are done, click on the <kbd>Terminal</kbd> tab to return to
the terminal. Note the `Overview` window at the top-right corner. Click on the
arrow to minimize or maximize the window.
