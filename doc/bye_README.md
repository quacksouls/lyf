Thank you for reading this far. I hope the tutorial has helped you to learn
programming in JavaScript. Better resources are available that cover the
language in more depth. To help you progress in your journey to mastery of
JavaScript, you might find the following useful:

1. Choose a book that covers basic JavaScript in more depth. You do not need to
   read the book from start to finish. Read a chapter or section. If you are
   confused/unsure of something you read, search online for more details or
   explanation. You might find the introductory book [_Eloquent
   JavaScript_][EloquentJS] useful.
1. Learn about algorithms and data structures. These resources can help:
    - [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures][jsDataStructure] -- An
      interactive course on JavaScript. Covers basic of the language as well as
      more advanced topics.
    - [Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript][algorithmJS] -- A video
      course.
    - [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures][algorithmVideo] -- Another
      video course.
    - Any introductory book on algorithms and data structures in JavaScript.
1. Learn about functional programming in JavaScript. These resources might help:
    - [An introduction to functional programming in JavaScript][fpJS] -- A short
      article on fundamental principles of functional programming.
    - [https://jrsinclair.com][sinclair] -- A blog on various techniques of
      functional programming and how to use them in JavaScript.
    - [_Functional-Light JavaScript_][fpLight] -- A book on basic principles of
      functional programming.
