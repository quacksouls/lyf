# JSON and the Argonauts

This chapter describes
[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), a way
to organize data. Using JSON, we can organize data into a collection called an
_object_. We will not cover everything about JSON, only a small number of ways
in which JSON can be used to help you model data in your programs.
