In this chapter, you will learn how to create and present a graphical user
interface (GUI). While JavaScript and
[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) are used to create a
GUI, it is [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) that is
responsible for what your GUI looks like. HTML is concerned with the markup of
your GUI and CSS handles the presentation, while JavaScript is the programming
language that allows your GUI to be responsive to your input. The trio of
CSS/HTML/JavaScript will be used to walk you through the creation of a simple
dialog box.
