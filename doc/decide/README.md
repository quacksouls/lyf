# Decision, decision

This chapter is about making decisions. You will learn various JavaScript
statements that allow your programs to make simple decisions. Chain the
statements together to allow your programs to execute code along various paths,
depending on the choices you make. For the case where you need to run a bunch of
code over and over again, JavaScript has various statements that can be used to
loop over the code until a condition is met.
