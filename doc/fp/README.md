# Let's get functional

This chapter discusses some basic ways to help you get started on functional
programming. Procedural and object-oriented programming are about writing
programs that specify the steps required to achieve a goal. Functional
programming is about declaring the goal you want to achieve. The procedural vs
declarative difference is not the only principle that separates functional
programming from other ways to program. However, the above difference is
sufficient to know for now to help you get started on writing functional
JavaScript code. See
[this article](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/functional-javascript) for an
introduction to basic principles of functional programming.
[This blog](https://jrsinclair.com/) and
[this book](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) discuss functional
programming in more depth, specifically using JavaScript.
