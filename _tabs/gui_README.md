In this chapter, you will learn how to create and present a graphical user
interface (GUI). While JavaScript and [HTML][html] are used to create a GUI, it
is [CSS][css] that is responsible for what your GUI looks like. HTML is
concerned with the markup of your GUI and CSS handles the presentation, while
JavaScript is the programming language that allows your GUI to be responsive to
your input. The trio of CSS/HTML/JavaScript will be used to walk you through the
creation of a simple dialog box.
